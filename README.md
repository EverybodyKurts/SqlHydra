# SqlHydra
SqlHydra is a [Myriad](https://github.com/MoiraeSoftware/myriad) plugin that generates F# records from a SQL Server SSDT .dacpac file.

[![NuGet version (SqlHydra)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SqlHydra.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SqlHydra/)

## Setup

1) Install `SqlHydra` and `Myriad.Sdk` from NuGet.

2) Add a `myriad.toml` configuration file to your project with the following:

```toml
[ssdt]
namespace = "AdventureWorks"
```

(The generated F# records will be added to the namespace you configure.)

3) Add an `ItemGroup` to your .fsproj file to configure a .dacpac input file and an .fs output file:

```xml
    <ItemGroup>
         <!-- Specify the .fs output file (to be generated by Myriad) -->
        <Compile Include="AdventureWorks.fs">
            <!-- Specify the .dacpac input  file -->
            <MyriadFile>../AdventureWorks/bin/Debug/AdventureWorks.dacpac</MyriadFile>
        </Compile>
    </ItemGroup>

```

4) Build your project to generate the .fs file.

5) Use your generated types with a micro ORM like FSharp.Dapper or RepoDb.

## Benefits of Myriad
* Myriad + SSDT is fast - very low impact on your build
* Myriad detects changes to SSDT .dacpac file and regenerates on next build
* Generated types are records, not classes (algebraic type safety for your data layer)
* Generated types can be used outside of project
* Generated types can be checked into source control (build server friendly)



## Roadmap
* Add a configuration option to add `[<CLIMutable>]` attribute to generated records (required by some ORMs like vanilla Dapper and EF).
* Possibly adding some generated helpers for db access
* <cool new thing here?>


## Known Issues
* User defined data types are not supported
* Computed table and view columns will default to a data type of `obj` since the data type is not listed in the .dacpac file. (See Type Annotations below.)

### Type Annotations
As a work-around for computed table and view columns having unresolved data types, the SSDT provider allows you to add type annotations directly to the table or view as in-line comments.

In the SalesOrderDetail.sql example table below, `[LineTotal]` is a computed column. Since the .dacpac file cannot determine the datatype for computed columns, the data type of the generated property will be defaulted to `obj`. As a workaround, an in-line type annotation `/* MONEY NOT NULL */` can be added. NOTE: for computed table columns, the comment annotation must be contained within the parentheses.

```sql
CREATE TABLE [SalesLT].[SalesOrderDetail] (
[SalesOrderID]       INT              NOT NULL,
[SalesOrderDetailID] INT              IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL,
[OrderQty]           SMALLINT         NOT NULL,
[ProductID]          INT              NOT NULL,
[UnitPrice]          MONEY            NOT NULL,
[UnitPriceDiscount]  MONEY            CONSTRAINT [DF_SalesOrderDetail_UnitPriceDiscount] DEFAULT ((0.0)) NOT NULL,
[LineTotal]          AS               (isnull(([UnitPrice]*((1.0)-[UnitPriceDiscount]))*[OrderQty],(0.0)) /* MONEY NOT NULL */ ),
[rowguid]            UNIQUEIDENTIFIER CONSTRAINT [DF_SalesOrderDetail_rowguid] DEFAULT (newid()) ROWGUIDCOL NOT NULL,
[ModifiedDate]       DATETIME         CONSTRAINT [DF_SalesOrderDetail_ModifiedDate] DEFAULT (getdate()) NOT NULL,
...
```

In the example `dbo.v_Hours` view below, the `Hours` column is not linked back to the `dbo.TimeEntries.Hours` column in the .dacpac metadata because it is a calculated field, so the data type of the generated property will be defaulted to `obj`. Adding a type annotation within an in-line comment will inform the SSDT provider of the data type to use in the generated `Hours` property:

```sql
CREATE VIEW dbo.v_Hours
AS
SELECT dbo.Projects.Name AS ProjectName, COALESCE (dbo.TimeEntries.Hours, 0) AS Hours /* decimal not null */, dbo.Users.Username
FROM dbo.Projects
INNER JOIN dbo.TimeEntries on dbo.Projects.Id = dbo.TimeEntries.ProjectId
INNER JOIN dbo.Users on dboUsers.Id = dbo.TimeEntries.UserId
```

_Notes:_
* If no null constraint is added after the column type, it will allow nulls by default.
* The annotations are case-insensitive.
* Hovering over a generated view property will designate if the data type was derived from a type annotations (or if it needs one).
* Do not include length information in the type annotation. For example, use varchar, not varchar(20).
